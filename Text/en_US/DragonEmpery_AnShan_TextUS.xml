			<Text>For An Shan, her strong industrial zone can provide her with a constant supply of [ICON_RESOURCE_IRON] Iron and [ICON_RESOURCE_ALUMINUM] Aluminium, which can be turned into a powerful driving force for the city's development. Therefore, it became the best choice for An Shan to develop Iron Working as soon as possible and popularise Ansteel in the city. An Shan will then gain a lot of [ICON_SCIENCE] Science and [ICON_Culture] Culture from the construction of the city. If any civilisation wants to try and conquer An Shan's cities, don't worry! An Shan's units will quickly even out the [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength gap and will quickly gain upgrades in battle. An Shan is very tricky for any civilisation. Under An Shan's guardianship, Dragon Empery will become the greatest nation in the world.</Text>

			<Text>Between 14 and 22 April 1962, An Shan, together with Chang Chun, Tai Yuan and two minesweepers and one submarine, maintained a formation of two destroyers and one minesweeper (submarine) for eight days to monitor the U.S.S. Di Haiwen, which operated outside China's territorial waters off Qingdao and issued a serious warning against its intrusion into China's territorial waters. From 29 September to 5 October 1963, in conjunction with the Fu Shun, the U.S. Navy destroyer Brewer was under surveillance off the Shandong and Liaodong Peninsulas to monitor the U.S. Navy destroyer Brewer, which had come close to China for reconnaissance during China's National Day.</Text>
